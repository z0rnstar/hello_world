# hello_world
First repository, learning the basics of GitHub.

I'm sure this file will contain more text as I find more things to put here :) As it stands right now, this is bare for want of content. It will be updated periodically to reflect changes in content.

Learning about branches and committs at the moment. Very exciting stuff, I'm sure. Hopefully I will only ever be the sole viewer of this.
